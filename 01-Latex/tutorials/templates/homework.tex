\section{Problems (solutions only)}

\begin{problem}{7}
(a) $E \cup E^c = S$.

(b) $EE^c = \emptyset$.

(c) $(E\cup F)(E\cup F^c) = E$.

(d) $(E\cup F)(E^c\cup F)(E\cup F^c) = EF$.

(e) $(E\cup F)(F\cup G) = EG\cup F$.
\end{problem}

\section{Problems (with the question)}

\begin{problem}{12}
If $\PP(E)=.9$ and $\PP(F)=.9$, show that $\PP(EF)\ge.8$.
In general, prove Bonferroni's inequality, namely that
\[ \PP(EF) \ge \PP(E) + \PP(F) - 1. \]
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
Since
\[ 1 = \PP(S) \ge \PP(E\cup F) = \PP(E)+\PP(F) - \PP(EF), \]
we have
\[ \PP(EF) \ge \PP(E)+\PP(F)-1. \]
\end{solution}

\section{Exercises (solution only)}

\begin{exercise}{18}
(a) For each boy, the number of permutations in which that boy is at the $4$th
position is $14!$.
Thus, the probability in question is
\[ \frac{5\cdot 14!}{15!} = \frac{5}{15} = \frac{1}{3}. \]

(b) The same logic as in (a) holds. Thus the probability is $1/3$.

(c) It is $14!/15! = 1/15$.
\end{exercise}

\section{Exercises (with the question)}

\begin{exercise}{27}
There are two local factories that produce microwaves.
Each microwave produced at factory $A$ is defective with probability $.05$,
whereas each one produced at factory $B$ is defective with probability $.01$.
Suppose you purchase two microwaves that were produced at the same factory,
which is equally likely to have been either factory $A$ or factory $B$.
If the first microwave that you check is defective, what is the conditional
probability that the other one is also defective?
\end{exercise}

\begin{solution}
Let $A$, $D_1$, and $D_2$ be the events that the microwaves are produced at factory $A$, the first microwave is defective, and the second microwave
is defective.
Note that
\begin{equation} \label{eq:cond_A}
\PP(D_1D_2|A) = \PP(D_1|A)\PP(D_2|A) = .05^2
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation} \label{eq:cond_Ac}
\PP(D_1D_2|A^c) = \PP(D_1|A^c)\PP(D_2|A^c) = .01^2
\end{equation}
hold. Combining \eqref{eq:cond_A} and \eqref{eq:cond_Ac}, we have
\[
\begin{split}
\PP(D_2|D_1) &= \frac{\PP(D_1D_2|A)\PP(A) + \PP(D_1D_2|A^c)\PP(A^c)}{
\PP(D_1|A)\PP(A) + \PP(D_1|A^c)\PP(A^c)} \\
&= \frac{.05^2 \times .5 + .01^2 \times .5}{.05 \times .5 + .01 \times .5}
= \frac{13}{300} \approx .043.
\end{split}
\]
\end{solution}
